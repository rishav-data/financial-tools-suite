# 💼 Financial Tools Suite

This repository contains **13 front-end financial tools** I built during my **2nd year of B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (Data Science)**. These tools were originally designed for my **startup project**, which aimed to simplify personal and business finance management for Indian users.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

Each tool is a standalone web-based application with:

* **Auto-calculation logic** embedded directly in the HTML/JavaScript.
* A **"Data Cart"** feature to cache live user table inputs in the browser.
* Export functionality for **CSV** and **JSON** formats.
* UI optimized for clarity and usability.

## 🚀 Startup Vision Behind the Tools

The tools were part of a broader mission:

> 🧾 To empower everyday Indians to manage finances, tabulate records, and generate IT-compliant reports — without requiring an accountant or advanced financial knowledge.

Originally, we planned to:

* Integrate AI to **analyze cached user data** and generate full financial reports.
* Enable user authentication and **secure record storage** in a cloud backend.

These individual tools were later scrapped in favor of a **more advanced, unified application**, currently in development.
