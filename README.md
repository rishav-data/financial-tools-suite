# financial-tools-suite
The 12 financial tools were built by me in my second of college persuing Bachelor of Technology Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) . They are the front end that were initially meant for my startup website offering users a way to tabulate and auto calculate queries regarding their finances. They all had a data cart function which when clicked by the user , add's the live table data to a local data cache . This cache data was then planned to be dumped to an AI to be able to condense all of it and generate a financial report the user can submit to the Indian Income Tax department . Our vision was to enable the common man to be able to start businesses or keep financial track records without worries of getting overwhelmed . The tools were the front end for with all automatic calculations embedded within the HTML and Javascript code itself . We had planned to make the backend so that the user could store their fanancial records in the startup tool itself after they had created an account and logged in . These tools were later scrapped for an even more efficient single tool we plan to deploy with our startup . I leveraged multiple AI tools like Chatgpt , DeepSeek , Claude , Loveable and Mistral AI along with my own knowledge of HTML , CSSS and Javascript  to code , debug , test and run these tools . These tools have functional buttons to remove entries and then download the live data table as CSV or JSON if the user prefers upload data manually to any AI or change the data for their convinience . 

All the tools are built focusing on Indian laws and financial system to make financing easier for the everyday user . These may be scrapped tools but I am showcasing them to put forward my skills for Front End development leveraging AI .
